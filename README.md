# Hiina kabe

Simple Chinese checkers game made for [ASI karikas 2022](https://asikarikas.ee), using Javascript and p5.js library for graphics.

## Features

This game allows to play with up to 6 players, either with real players or with AI players.  
The AI player makes their move by attempting to move their nearest piece to the furtherest free slot of enemy's corner by
using simple vector algebra for calculation. Whenever possible the AI attempts to perform jumps across multiple pieces 
to achieve closest position to the destination.
